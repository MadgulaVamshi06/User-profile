I have utilized advanced state management techniques by using the useState hook to manage both the array of users and the search input for filtering. 
This approach simplifies state handling and makes the application more scalable.
Conditional rendering is applied effectively in the project. 
The user interface updates dynamically based on user input. 
When the search input is empty, no user profiles are displayed. However, as soon as the user starts typing, the filtered user profiles are rendered instantly.
Event handling in React is demonstrated through the onChange event on the input field. 
The onChange event triggers a function that updates the state with the current value of the input field. 
This allows for real-time filtering of user profiles based on the search input.
