I have utilized advanced state management techniques by using the useState hook to manage both the array of users and the search input for filtering. 
This approach simplifies state handling and makes the application more scalable.
Conditional rendering is applied effectively in the project. 
The user interface updates dynamically based on user input. 
When the search input is empty, no user profiles are displayed. However, as soon as the user starts typing, the filtered user profiles are rendered instantly.
Event handling in React is demonstrated through the onChange event on the input field. 
The onChange event triggers a function that updates the state with the current value of the input field. 
This allows for real-time filtering of user profiles based on the search input.

Instructions to Run the Project: 
To run the project, simply copy the provided HTML code along with the embedded React and Babel scripts into an HTML file. Then, open the HTML file in a web browser. The project will render a search input field where you can enter a username. As you type, the user profiles matching the entered username will be displayed in real-time.

Search Functionality: The project implements a search functionality that allows users to filter user profiles based on their first or last names. As the user types in the search input field, the application dynamically filters the user profiles and displays only those that match the entered text. This feature enhances user experience by enabling quick and efficient navigation through a potentially large list of user profiles.
